# _**AI-Enhanced Engagement Tracker for Young Learners**_ üìö‚ú®

Welcome to the **AI-Enhanced Engagement Tracker for Young Learners**! This project is developed by **Subham Sahoo** during an internship at **Infosys Springboard**.

## **Overview** üåü

The **AI-Enhanced Engagement Tracker** aims to improve the learning experience for young learners
by monitoring and analyzing their engagement levels in real-time. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, 
this system provides actionable insights to educators and guardians, creating a more effective and personalized learning environment.

## **Project Structure** üìÅ

This repository contains the following 3 folders for now :

### [image_processing_techniques](https://github.com/SubhamSahooAIML/SubhamSahoo_AI-Enhanced-Engagement-Tracker-for-Young-Learners_Infosys_Internship_Oct2024/tree/main/image_processing%20techniques) üñºÔ∏è
1. IMG_Dilation&erosion.py 

   This script performs dilation and erosion operations on images, which are fundamental morphological operations used in image processing.

2. IMG_EdgeDection.py

   This script detects edges in images using various edge detection algorithms, which are crucial for identifying object boundaries.

3. IMG_GrayscaleNB&Wimg.py

   This script converts images to grayscale and black & white, which are common preprocessing steps in image analysis.

4. IMG_HSV.py

   This script converts images to the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, which is often used in color-based image segmentation.

5. IMG_Multiple_Image_opener.py

   This script allows for opening and processing multiple images simultaneously, facilitating batch image processing.

6. IMG_Rotating_img.py

   This script rotates images by a specified angle, which can be useful for image alignment and augmentation.

7. IMG_Single_image_opener.py

   This script opens and processes a single image, serving as a basic utility for image manipulation.

8. IMG_blur.py

   This script applies various blurring techniques to images, which can be used for noise reduction and smoothing.

9. IMG_concatination.py

   This script concatenates multiple images into a single image, which can be useful for creating image mosaics or comparisons.

10. IMG_contouring.py

    This script detects and draws contours around objects in images, which is useful for shape analysis and object detection.

11. IMG_cropping.py

    This script crops images to a specified region, which is useful for focusing on specific areas of interest.

12. IMG_hist_eq.py

    This script performs histogram equalization on images, which enhances the contrast of images.

13. IMG_morphilogicalnoise_removal.py

    This script removes noise from images using morphological operations, improving image quality.

14. IMG_resizing_img.py

    This script resizes images to specified dimensions, which is essential for standardizing image sizes.

15. IMG_template.py

    This script serves as a template for creating new image processing scripts, providing a basic structure to follow.


### [video_processing_techniques](https://github.com/SubhamSahooAIML/SubhamSahoo_AI-Enhanced-Engagement-Tracker-for-Young-Learners_Infosys_Internship_Oct2024/tree/main/video_processing%20techniques)üé•

Includes various video processing methods implemented.

1. Video_recording.py

   This script allows you to record videos using your webcam or another connected camera. It captures the video feed, processes it, and saves it to a specified file format.

2. Video_stacking.py

   This script stacks multiple video streams into a single video frame. It can be used to display multiple video feeds simultaneously in a grid format, making it useful for monitoring multiple camera sources.

3. video_Fps_Calculator.py

   This script calculates the frames per second (FPS) of a video stream. It helps in analyzing the performance of video processing by providing real-time FPS data.

4. video_multivideostream.py

   This script processes and displays multiple video streams simultaneously. It is designed to handle multiple video inputs and render them together, allowing for complex video processing and comparison tasks.

5. video_stream.py

   This script streams video from a file or camera in real-time. It serves as a basic utility for streaming video feeds, which can be extended for more advanced processing tasks.

Stores the annotations used for model training and evaluation.

1. input_img.jpeg:
   Sample image file used for testing and demonstration purposes.

2. kaggle_install.py:
    Script for installing necessary packages or dependencies from Kaggle.

3. labelIMG.py:
    Script for labeling images with specific labels or categories.

4. label_img_output.txt:
    Output file containing results from the labelIMG.py script.

5. label_manipulation.py:
     Script for manipulating image labels (e.g., modifying, updating).

6. segregation.py:
    Script for segregating data into different categories or groups.
